# VKGraphics
VKGraphics is a modern cross platform abstraction over Vulkan, based on [OpenTK 5](https://github.com/opentk/opentk/tree/opentk5.0).

**This project was originally based on the [Veldrid](https://github.com/veldrid/veldrid) forks by [nike4613](https://github.com/nike4613/veldrid/tree/vulkan-sync) and [TechPizzaDev](https://github.com/TechPizzaDev/veldrid), I only extracted the Vulkan backend, ported it to use the OpenTK bindings and added PAL2 Window creation support.**
